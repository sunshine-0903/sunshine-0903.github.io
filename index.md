## About Me

Hi! I am a visiting student in [ENCODE Lab](https://westlake-encode-lab.github.io/) at Westlake University, under the supervision of [Prof. Huan Wang](https://www.huanwang.tech/). I obtained my M.Eng. in Communication Engineering from Beihang University in 2025 and B.Eng. in Communication Engineering at Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2022.

My current research focuses on model efficiency and optimization, particularly LLM pruning and quantization.
